Creating a evolution in the Indian Agricultural System


## About the app

Well the inspiration for this project for us came from one of the worse phases our country has every faced, the introduction of the 3-farm bills by the incumbent government in power to the repealing of these farm laws. 
From that we understood that to farmers what was more important was the security that the MSP & Mandi system provided over the high risk-high reward that would have been enacted if the bills stayed. 

So essentially our project focuses on rather evolutionising the existing systems in place over revolutionising them. 
We are digitising the Mandi auction system set by the government in place in accordance to the MSP system.
